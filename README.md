# Segmentation using MobileNet Backbone
After understanding the concept of UNet, the task would be to use MobileNet backbone as a pretrained backbone for segmentation. 

The aim is to have a network that can do semantic segmentation in real-time using only CPU based inferencing.
The architecture will be added to this after consideration. Thanks

### Tasks
- [X] Decide the backbone - MobileNetV2
- [] Decide the dataset to work on
- [] Decide the architecure (modifications and extensions to the MobileNetV2)
- [] Coding the loss metrics by plotting using TensorBoard
- [] Training the network
- [] Results
- [] Inference time on different architectures - PC - CPU, Laptop CPU, Raspberry Pi 4, Google Coral Dev Board
- [] Video of the results
